Crypto is full of fools, including myself. It is a place where dreams and greed collide, where many rush in without understanding, hoping to strike gold. 

We get caught in the hype, chasing illusions of wealth and power, only to stumble and fall. Yet, in the chaos, there is learning. 

Every mistake teaches, every loss shapes. To stay is to accept being a fool who learns, one who dreams and dares. 

The world may call us fools, but fools often build what the wise never imagine.
