With the rise of technology, many countries try to be the next Silicon Valley.

Vietnam gets promoted as the next rising star among ASEAN states, producing many startups and talents each year. Countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore are all doing well.

With all respect, they aren't close to Silicon Valley. They are unique in their own way, because no place on earth can be another Silicon Valley.

Cambodia shouldn't try to be Silicon Valley or Vietnam, because we won't be them. They are what they are because of what they did long ago. Silicon Valley goes back more than 100 years, building a foundation that reached critical mass in the 60s and 70s. Vietnam invested in talents and infrastructure for decades to build their solid foundation.

We shouldn't compare ourselves too much. We should look inside to understand our strengths and what Cambodia should focus on. Then put all our effort to achieve that, whatever it takes.

Celebrate those who have done well. Learn from them. But we can't replicate what they did in a different time and space. We can learn from their past, but we can't live in the past. We must focus on our future.

Ecosystems can't be built. They have to be grown. What grows takes time but lasts longer. What gets built shows quick results but rarely lasts.

Want to study successful countries? Look at what they did 10-20 years ago, not their current outcomes.

For our startup ecosystem to grow, we must work with what we have and be patient. Look at what the world will need in 3-5-10 years, then grow our talents and resources to prepare for that. Define our uniqueness and strength.

Everything moves fast. We can't focus on now when building ecosystems. The internet levels the playing field. Even with gatekeepers like Apple, Google, Amazon, we can enter the global market. AI and blockchain are reshaping everything—AI democratizes intelligence, blockchain democratizes trust. Both are releveling those big gatekeepers.

Train startups to build mobile apps for quick dollars? We'll walk a decade behind those who focus on the future. Successful mobile apps like Uber were built from 2007 to 2013. The window closed.

Look at what we have: resources, talents, and Cambodia's gift from the universe. Work with our natural strengths, not against them. Hard work with the right skills and tools, not just hard work.
