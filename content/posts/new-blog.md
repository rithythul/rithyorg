I'm building a new personal website with a Markdown-based structure for my upcoming blog. It's all set for my writing journey in 2025.

I'm learning to write in longer formats to better organize my thoughts.

This blog will be the place where I share all my ideas, starting on December 1st, 2024.

Previously, I used to post on my [Telegram channel](http://t.me/notestothyself). However, since I don't have a Telegram membership, I was limited to posting short memos.

Now, I want to take this opportunity to write on my personal site, [rithy.org](https://rithy.org), which Iâ€™ve neglected for far too long.

And so, it begins!
